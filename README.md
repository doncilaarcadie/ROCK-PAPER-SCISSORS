# Rock Paper Scissors
A browser-based implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game, built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was created a few years ago as part of an in-class assignment during my Software Engineering degree. The main requirement was to build an interactive website without using any external libraries or frameworks, relying only on core web technologies.
The project focuses on JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and UI interaction, while also putting effort into a visually appealing design.
